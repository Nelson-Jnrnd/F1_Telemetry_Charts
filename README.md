# F1 Telemetry Charts 🏎️📊

This repository uses the [FastF1 API](https://theoehrly.github.io/Fast-F1/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) to generate detailed analysis of F1 sessions.

### Follow My Analysis 📝

I regularly post my analyses made with this project on my [website](https://nelson-jnrnd.github.io/blog/). Check it out for more insights and updates!

## Project Structure 📁

The project is organized into Jupyter notebooks, each tailored to analyze different session types. The notebooks are located in the `Notebooks` folder and follow this structure:

- `Notebooks/`
  - `preseason_analysis.ipynb`
  - `free_practice_analysis.ipynb`
  - `qualifying_analysis.ipynb`
  - `race_analysis.ipynb`

Each notebook generates folders at the root of the `notebooks` folder with the following structure:

```
Year/
  Race_location/
    Session_type/
      _graphs_/
```

## Usage 🚀

1. Clone this repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nelson-Jnrnd/F1_Telemetry_Charts.git
    cd F1_Telemetry_Charts
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Navigate to the `notebooks` folder and open the desired notebook using Jupyter.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/preseason_analysis.ipynb
    ```

4. Run the cells in the notebook to generate the analysis, you can specify which year, race-weekend and drivers you want to analyze. The generated graphs and data will be saved in the corresponding folders as described above.
